Files with extension `.Rmd` are [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) files.
We are going to practice compiling `.Rmd` files, i.e. knit them, to HTML pages.

1. Change the name of the author above to your name and change the date
1. Click on the arrow next to the "Knit" button above and select "Knit to HTML"
1. In the resulting pop-up window of an HTML page, click on "Publish" (in blue
on the top-right) -> RPubs -> Publish. Give it a title and a "slug" i.e. URL
completion. Your analysis is now online! You can update what's online by
repeating steps 2 and 3.
1. Copy the URL of the resulting RPubs page.
1. Replace the https://www.nhl.com/ URL below with the URL of your RPubs page:  
[My RPubs Document](https://www.nhl.com/)
1. Indicate how much time you spent on this assignment up to now, 
including forking the `HW-0` repo and setting up the RStudio project: 
1. Re-knit this document and update what's on RPubs.
1. Then submit this file only, `HW-0.Rmd`, following the steps on the repo page for `HW-0`.


## Examples

We'll learn R Markdown syntax as we go during the semester.

```{r}
data(mtcars)
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp)
```

See how we can seamlessly blend R code, R output, R plots, and text!

```{r}
summary(mtcars$wt)
```

blah blah
